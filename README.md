# Spring Boot REST & Java: From Theory to AWS with Intensive Practice

This project is the result of my intensive study on RESTful APIs, from basics to deployment on AWS, using Spring Boot 3, Java, and Docker. Inspired by the course I am taking on Udemy, this repository reflects the journey of learning and implementing a REST API from scratch.

## About the Project
This project is focused on providing a practical learning experience (90%) with a solid theoretical foundation (10%). The goal is to develop a RESTful API from scratch, following best market practices and using the most modern tools and frameworks available.

## Knowledge I have acquired and am acquiring throughout the project:
- REST Fundamentals: Understanding the theoretical concepts that underpin REST, the RESTful maturity model, and the main HTTP verbs.
- Practical Development: How to develop a practical RESTful API using the Spring Boot framework, focusing on features such as pagination, versioning, media types, content negotiation, file upload and download.
- Development Tools: Using Postman to make RESTful requests, API documentation with Swagger (Open API), and basic concepts of SQL and Migrations.
- Security: REST authentication techniques and security with JWT.
- Testing: Implementation of unit tests with JUnit 5 and Mockito, and integration tests with JUnit 5, REST Assured, and Testcontainers.
- AWS and DevOps: How to use key AWS services (RDS, EC2, IAM User, ECS) for deployment, as well as CI/CD practices with GitHub Actions for an automated workflow of integration and deployment on Amazon AWS.
- Integration and Consumption of APIs: Learning to consume third-party APIs and integrate with other services.

## Why this project?
This repository is not just a record of my progress in the course but also a source of practical knowledge for anyone who wants to learn to develop and deploy quality RESTful APIs. If you are looking for learning focused on real application, along with the exploration of advanced techniques and best practices in software development, this project is for you.

## How to Start
Feel free to clone this repository, explore the code, and use it as a base for your own projects. Each module contains specific implementations based on the technology or concept learned. This includes everything from REST fundamentals and JWT security to the use of AWS services and CI/CD practices.
